# Pegasus Victim Database
This database tracks details about victims of NSO Groupâ€™s Pegasus spyware. Each entry represents either an individual or small group of people, such as a team of lawyers. For that reason, you won't find single entries for the "1,400 mobile phones and devices" targeted [through WhatsApp](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.350613/gov.uscourts.cand.350613.1.0_3.pdf) or "15,000 individuals" [selected](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/19/fifty-people-close-mexico-president-amlo-among-potential-targets-nso-clients) for surveillance in Mexico. The goal is to make each entry as comprehensive as possible by collecting and sorting published reports. The database is updated regularly as more information becomes available.

## The Pegasus Project
The [Pegasus Project](https://forbiddenstories.org/case/the-pegasus-project/) was a large-scale investigation into the use of NSO's Pegasus spyware, coordinated by Forbidden Stories with technical support from Amnesty International. At the center of the investigation was a leaked list of 50,000 phone numbers said to have been selected for surveillance by NSO's customers since 2016. Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International shared the data with [15 media partners](https://forbiddenstories.org/about-the-pegasus-project/), including the Guardian and the Washington Post. Due to the sheer number of potential victims disclosed by the investigation, this database may contain some discrepancies and duplicate entries.
